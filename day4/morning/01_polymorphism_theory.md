# OOP - Polymorphism & Abstraction

## What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism means "many forms". In Python, it allows objects of different types to be treated as instances of the same type through a common interface.

## Types of Polymorphism in Python:

### 1. Duck Typing
"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it's a duck"
- Python doesn't check the type of an object, but whether it has the required methods

### 2. Method Overriding
Child classes can override parent class methods

### 3. Method Overloading (operator overloading)
Defining multiple behaviors for operators

## Key Concepts:
- **Polymorphism**: Same interface, different implementations
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details
- **Duck Typing**: Type checking at runtime based on methods/attributes
- **Abstract Base Classes (ABC)**: Define interfaces that must be implemented

## Job Interview Benefits:
- Shows understanding of OOP principles
- Demonstrates ability to write maintainable code
- Essential for design patterns
- Common in real-world applications
