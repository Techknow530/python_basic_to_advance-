# Project Refactoring & Documentation Guide

## What is Code Refactoring?
Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.

## Why Refactor?
- **Readability**: Make code easier to understand
- **Maintainability**: Easier to modify and extend
- **Performance**: Optimize for better execution
- **Best Practices**: Follow coding standards
- **Job Ready**: Professional-quality code

## PEP 8 - Python Style Guide
PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python code.

### Key PEP 8 Rules:
1. **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces per indentation level
2. **Line Length**: Maximum 79 characters
3. **Imports**: 
   - Each import on separate line
   - Standard library first, then third-party, then local
4. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Functions and variables: `snake_case`
   - Classes: `PascalCase`
   - Constants: `UPPER_CASE`
5. **Whitespace**:
   - No trailing whitespace
   - Two blank lines before class/function definitions
   - One blank line between methods

## Documentation Best Practices:

### 1. Docstrings
```python
def function_name(param1, param2):
    """
    Brief description of function.
    
    Args:
        param1 (type): Description of param1
        param2 (type): Description of param2
    
    Returns:
        type: Description of return value
    
    Raises:
        ExceptionType: Description of when this exception is raised
    """
    pass
```

### 2. Comments
- Use comments to explain **why**, not **what**
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Use inline comments sparingly

### 3. README.md Structure
```markdown
# Project Name
