'''Decorators in Python represent a powerful and flexible design pattern that enables the modification or extension of a function's or method's behavior without
altering its original source code. 1  At its core, a decorator is a function that accepts another function as an argument and returns a new function with augmented 
capabilities. 2  This mechanism is deeply rooted in Python's treatment of functions as first-class objects, which means functions can be assigned to variables,
passed as arguments, and returned from other functions, much like any other data type.'''
